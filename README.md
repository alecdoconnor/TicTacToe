Play Master Splinter in an unbeatable game of TicTacToe in Excel

Built in Excel, this game of Tic Tac Toe is the ultimate game. I led a team in a programming class in building this game.

It can be played player vs. player or player vs. computer. There are two modes while playing the computer: <easy> or <hard>. Hard is impossible to beat and easy is still pretty hard, but do-able. Watch out for Master Splinter and a few of his words of wisdom.



Fun facts!
- Enable the detailed analysis on hard mode to see why Master Splinter cannot lose.
- It's possible to change the color of the game board
  * Pick your favorite color in the 'New Game' menu
